Inspired by the theme of the night sky, we set out to create a mobile application that can execute real-time constellation detection. Since most people have a difficult time recognizing constellations, they can simply point their camera towards the sky to find a specific star or pattern.

Using AR, ML and geolocation APIs, this app encourages everyone to take a break from their hectic daily lives and go enjoy the outdoors.
